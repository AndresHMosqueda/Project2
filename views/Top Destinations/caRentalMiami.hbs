<h1>Car Rental Miami</h1>

<p>Miami offers many fun and exciting attractions, JUT is happy to get you where you need to go.

While Miami is typically warm all year, there are definitely activities that are better suited for the summer and winter months. When it’s warm, a convertible is the perfect mode of transportation. If you are sticking around for a while, long-term JUT offer fantastic rates.

If you feel nervous about driving around Miami, try our GPS navigation or rent a Smart Car. Both will make your life so much easier. Don’t forget to buy a full tank of gas when you rent your car so you don’t have to worry about filling it up upon return. If you have an JUT Preferred membership, you can take advantage of our fuel service option when you book your rental car.</p>
